<p>
Lomads, however, is building a refreshingly clean and user-focused dashboard that allows for a central sense of truth and transparency, seamless team onboarding, and automation of smart contracts to save time while reducing the risk of errors.
</p>

<p>
Lomads is currently focused on streamlining transactions and permissions for organizations through our automation features. We allow organizations to:

- Easily automate various transactions such as recurring payments, milestone-based payments, bounties, and batch payments
- Launch "Soulbound Tokens" (SBT) for their members. These tokens can be used to automate permissions for various Web2 and Web3 apps (such as Discord, Notion, and Snapshot) based on members' roles and contributions.
</p>

<p>
Validation is essential for transactions, and over time, SBTs will play a crucial role in enabling permissionless transactions. This one-of-a-kind combination of dashboards with SBTs gives Lomads a strong edge over the competition and primes it for ecosystem growth and expansion.
